# Arduino alarm clock (project in progress..)
An alarm clock built using the Arduino platform that features a standalone RTC module, large 7 segment display, temp/humidity display, automatic brightness setting and more.
This project is designed around the state and template design patterns featuring an extensive amount of C++ classes instead of the more usual approach of writing all the code in the .ino file, therefore promoting good software development practices and keeping it as readable and clean as possible.
